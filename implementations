THE ENVIRONMENT:
	Make a copy of the environment once to new_environ
	setenv:
	 already implemented
	getenv:
	already implemented
	unsetenv:
		when unsetenv is called, it goes through the environment and looks for
		match. if no match is found, it returns
		else if a match is found, constructs a new deleted struct
		sets it index and value, appends it to the trash environment, and frees the entry in the
		main environment
implement a trash list for deleted environment variable:
	-this trash list is a linked list of deleted variables
	-each deleted struct holds the index from which it was popped off
	and also it's value( in the form :"name=value")
	-when setenv is called, it first looks into the trash environment 
	if trash is empty, it appends to the environment normally
	if trash is not empty, it fills the position of the deleted struct

THE PATH:
	the path is an entry in the environment extracted to it's own linked list
	trace: returns the absolute path of a command
ALIAS:
	the alias is a linked list
	when alias is called, it goes through the argument list passed
	if there's no argument passed to it, it basically gets a list of aliases
	if there's an equal sign in an argument, it separates it into two operands and it calls _setalias on it
	if there's no equal sign, it calls a _getalias on the single operand - prints out the equivalent value followed by a new line
